# Project Overview

This repository is organized into five main directories, each dedicated to specific aspects of image processing and computer vision tasks. Below is a description of each directory along with the key concepts involved.

## 1. Image_Classification_and_Segmentation
This directory focuses on combining image classification with image segmentation to identify and label objects in images.

### Key Concepts:
- **Image Segmentation:** Dividing an image into regions or objects for easier analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracting features from images to feed into classification models.
- **Pixel-Level Classification:** Assigning a class label to each pixel.

## 2. Image_Classification_with_CNN
This directory implements image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It demonstrates the use of CNN layers to extract spatial features from images.

### Key Concepts:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Learning spatial hierarchies in image data.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reducing the spatial dimensions of feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Performing classification tasks based on extracted features.

---

## 3. Multi-Class_Image_Classification
This directory focuses on solving multi-class classification problems, where images belong to one of several possible categories.

### Key Concepts:
- **Softmax Activation:** Converting raw logits into probabilities.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss:** Measuring the performance of classification models.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Techniques like data augmentation and weighted loss.

## 4. Object_Detection
This directory covers detecting objects within images and marking their locations with bounding boxes.

### Key Concepts:
- **Bounding Box Regression:** Predicting the coordinates of object boundaries.
- **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):** Filtering overlapping bounding boxes.
- **Anchor Boxes:** Predefined boxes used for detecting objects of varying sizes.

## 5. Transformations
This directory includes data transformation techniques used to augment and preprocess images.

### Key Concepts:
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhancing dataset variability through transformations (e.g., flipping, rotation).
- **Normalization:** Scaling image pixel values for consistent model performance.
- **Randomized Transformations:** Improving model generalization through randomness.
